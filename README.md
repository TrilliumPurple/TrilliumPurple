- 👋 Hi, I’m @TrilliumPurple, I wanted PurpleTrillium but that name was already taken.
- 👀 I’m interested in far too many things to list here, but to mention a couple near the top of my list, business and self education (learning what ever I can).  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving and adding features to my personal website.
- 📫 How to reach me? Shoot me an email, hiadse@outlook.com and we can go from there.
